# 🎯 Frontend Take-Home Test — Session Finder + Schedule

## How to Run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```


##  What I’d Improve With More Time

- Improve validation and display inline errors.

- Refactor inputs, buttons, and the SessionCard into fully reusable and styled components.

- Navbar & layout polish: add a logo, improve navigation and responsive behavior.

- Animations & microinteractions: enhance the UI with better smooth hover transitions, fade-ins  and loading spinners to provide visual feedback during data fetching.

- Enhance accessibility with aria-labels and keyboard support.

- Add toast notifications when adding/removing sessions to make interactions more responsive.

- Migrate to TypeScript to catch errors earlier and improve code maintainability.


## Libraries Used

**React Router DOM**  
- Used for managing client-side routing and navigation between pages (`Search`, `MySchedule`, and `Register`).  
- It provides a simple way to handle dynamic rendering of views without reloading the page, keeping the experience smooth and consistent.  

**Tailwind CSS**  
- Chosen for its utility-first approach, allowing rapid styling directly within JSX while maintaining consistency.  
- It helps keep the codebase lightweight and avoids the need for external CSS files or complex naming conventions.  

## Personal Touch

I focused on keeping the UI clean and easy to navigate while making the experience smooth and responsive.
I added subtle transitions, hover states, and layout consistency to make the interface feel cohesive.

My goal was to show attention to detail in both code organization and user experience.
